					<p>To keep the cost as low as possible, MLM.ZONE will only be promoted from person to person.</p><br/>
					<p>Yes, we know what you think and yes, you will be rewarded to share this exciting product <br/>
					with your friends and colleagues.</p><br/>
					<p>
						We had a little challenge here as we absolutely do not want to interfere with your current company<br/>
						and their rules and regulations, so we decided to share a % of the global profits with everyone<br/>
						that shares and boost sales. No mlm levels, no mlm structures, no mlm compensation plans,<br/>
						just a profitshare for the people that generate sales and help us grow.</p><br/>
					<p>I hear you thinking:<br/>
					“How will that work?”</p><br/>
					<p>
					Short answer: “It will work better than you can imagine!”
					</p><br/>
					<p>More info will be available soon in our newsletter...</p>
